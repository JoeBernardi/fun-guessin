        <strong>STEP 2:</strong> Mystery Phrase
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've guessed the correct number, the payload will also include a property called `nextNumber`. `nextNumber` will be higher than 2000, but if it's "guessed" using the format from step 1, it will return an object with both `letter` and `nextNumber` properties. By assembling the `letter`s over the course of guessing each `nextNumber`, you'll put together a sentence, which is the solution to the puzzle. (The final `letter` will not have a `nextNumber` included.)
